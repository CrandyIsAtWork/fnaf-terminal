# FNAF 6: Pizzeria Simulator - Task Terminal

> An interactive web-based simulation of the office task terminal from Five Nights at Freddy's: Pizzeria Simulator (FNAF 6).

This project is a recreation of the daily computer tasks from the game, built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to capture the retro CRT monitor aesthetic and tense atmosphere.

## ## About The Project

This simulation was built as a fun, interactive web project to replicate a core mechanic of *FNAF: Pizzeria Simulator*. The goal was to create a convincing and functional version of the terminal, complete with its characteristic scanlines, pixelated font, sound effects, and the ever-present threat of ad interruptions.

## ## Features

* **Retro Interface:** Styled to look like an old CRT monitor, complete with a pixel font and scanline effects.
* **Boot-Up Sequence:** The terminal requires you to "POWER ON" and wait through a 15-second loading screen.
* **Interactive Task List:** Complete tasks like "Order Supplies" and "Print Flyers."
* **Timed Progress:** Each task takes a set amount of time to complete, shown on a progress bar.
* **Ad Pop-ups:** Random ad pop-ups will interrupt your tasks, just like in the game!
* **Sound Effects:** UI sounds for clicks and actions to enhance the immersive experience.
